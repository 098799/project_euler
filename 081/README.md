# Problem 81
This is a solution to the [problem 81](https://projecteuler.net/problem=81) from Project Euler. I'm trying to be a little bit better at following TDD commandments as well as best practises, so I decided to write this one with unit testing in mind.

You can see the actual code being used in `path/path.py`. The tests are in `tests/test_path.py`. After installing requirements via `pip install -r requirements.txt` you can just run the tests with `pytest` and get the answer, or do the coverage (100%) testing with `tox` via `tox -e py36`.
